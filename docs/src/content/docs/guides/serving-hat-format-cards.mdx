Configure `ygo-card-image-hosting` to archive and serve card images for [HAT Format](https://hatformatmeta.com/).

## What is HAT Format?

HAT Format is a Yu-Gi-Oh! format from the summer of 2014. The format commonly played online specifically emulates the 2014 North American World Championship Qualifier (NAWCQ), using the April 2014 Banlist, a card pool up to and including the **Realm of Light Structure Deck**, and North American Master Rule 2 rulings.

## Configuring for HAT Format

Update your `.env` file with these values:

```dotenv
# YGOPRODECK
START_DATE=2002-03-01
END_DATE=2014-05-30
DATE_REGION=tcg
```

## Running with HAT Format

Ensure initial [Terraform setup](/ygo-card-image-hosting/getting-started/running-the-project/#set-up-aws-infrastructure-with-terraform) is done (only once).

Run the script from the project root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

<Aside>The script skips images already in S3, only adding new ones.</Aside>

Access images via your CloudFront URL with the correct path based on `CARD_SIZE`.
