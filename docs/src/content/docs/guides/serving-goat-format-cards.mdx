Configure `ygo-card-image-hosting` to archive and serve card images for [GOAT Format](https://www.goatformat.com/gettingstarted.html).

## What is GOAT Format?

A format based on the summer 2005 Yu-Gi-Oh! era. The widely accepted card pool includes cards up to **The Lost Millennium (TLM)**, excluding **Exarion Universe** and **Cybernetic Revolution (CRV)**.

## Configuring for GOAT Format

Update your `.env` file with these values:

```dotenv
# YGOPRODECK
START_DATE=2002-03-01
END_DATE=2005-07-10
DATE_REGION=tcg
```

## Running with GOAT Format

Ensure initial [Terraform setup](/ygo-card-image-hosting/getting-started/running-the-project/#set-up-aws-infrastructure-with-terraform) is done (only once).

Run the script from the project root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

<Aside>The script skips images already in S3, only adding new ones.</Aside>

Access images via your CloudFront URL with the correct path based on `CARD_SIZE`.
