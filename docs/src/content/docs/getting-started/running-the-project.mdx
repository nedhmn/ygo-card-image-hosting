Set up your AWS infrastructure and run the image archiving script using the steps below.

## Set up AWS Infrastructure with Terraform

From the project root, run the Terraform script:

```bash
bash scripts/run_terraform.sh
```

Follow the prompts.

<Aside>
  CloudFront setup can take up to 15 minutes to apply after `terraform apply`
  completes.
</Aside>

The script will print the CloudFront url. **Save this url.**

## Run the Image Archiving Script

From the project root, build and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

Logs will show the download/upload progress.

<Aside>
  The YGOPRODeck API has a 20 requests/sec rate limit. Downloads may take
  several minutes.
</Aside>

## Verifying the Setup

After both steps complete, test by visiting the URL for "Dark Magician" in your browser:

```
<your-cloudfront-prefix-url>/images/cards/46986414.jpg
```

Replace `<your-cloudfront-prefix-url>` with the saved url.

<Aside>
  **Important:** The URL path depends on your `CARD_SIZE` in `.env`:
  <ul>
    <li>`FULL` (default): `/images/cards/`</li>
    <li>`SMALL`: `/images/cards_small/`</li>
    <li>`CROPPED`: `/images/cards_cropped/`</li>
  </ul>
</Aside>

If you see the image, your setup is working.
