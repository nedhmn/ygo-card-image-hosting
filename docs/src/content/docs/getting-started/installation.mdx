This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to get `ygo-card-image-hosting` set up on your local machine. Before you begin, you'll need to ensure you have the following prerequisites installed.

## Prerequisites

- **AWS Account:** You will need an active Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. If you don't have one, you can sign up on the [AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com/).
- **Terraform:** The project uses Terraform to provision your AWS infrastructure. Follow the official [Terraform installation guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) for your operating system.
- **Docker:** You will need either [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (for Windows or macOS) or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (for Linux).
- **Docker Compose:** This is typically installed alongside Docker Desktop or can be installed separately for Docker Engine ([installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)).
- **Git:** For cloning the bot's repository ([installation guide](https://git-scm.com/downloads)).

## Cloning the Repository

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can clone the `ygo-card-image-hosting` repository from GitHub.

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project files.
3.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nedhmn/ygo-card-image-hosting.git
    ```

4.  Navigate into the cloned directory:

    ```bash
    cd ygo-card-image-hosting
    ```

You have now successfully installed the prerequisites and obtained the project files. The next step is to configure the project with your AWS details and other settings.
